# Prnt.sc Scraper
This repo contains code for a python script that automatically generates many random prnt.sc addresses and proceeds to download the screenshot/picture in the code. This script can easily be changed to run your own list of prnt.sc addresses in order to download the screenshots you had.

## Deprecated
This has since been deprecated as Prnt.sc has made a very ratelimit of how many images you can download.
